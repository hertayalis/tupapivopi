On the 25th of June, the ceremony will be held in Los Angeles, California at the Microsoft Theater. Although a host is yet to be announced, one should be revealed within the next couple of days. However, one major category that’s garnered attention is that of the Best Actress.&nbsp;</p><p>At the previous year’s ceremony, the number of nominees increased from six to nine, but the number has been brought down to seven in 2023. Currently holding the title is Zendaya, who won for her roles in HBO’s Euphoria and Spider-Man: No Way Home. First-time nominees include Abbot Elementary’s standout star Janelle James, as well as Keke Palmer for her star-elevating turn in the Western horror movie, Nope.&nbsp;</p><p>The competition is as tight as ever. Regardless, here are all the seven nominees up for Best Actress at the 2023 BET Awards.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-angela-bassett>Angela Bassett</h2></span><p>Angela Bassett has already made history as the first MCU actor to earn an acting award at major awards ceremonies. So it’s no surprise that she’s once again earned another nod at the upcoming BET Awards. Bassett’s nomination for Best Actress officially makes her the most nominated woman in the history of the category. She has been up for the trophy eleven times in the past, and this year marks her twelfth time.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, she’s yet to snag the award, but her recent win streak might spell a different tale this year. In addition to her work as Queen Ramonda in <a href=# rel>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>, Basset’s nod also recognizes her work in television. Her leading role as Sergeant Athena Grant-Nash on the procedural drama 9-1-1 has been continuously commended.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>2023 BET Awards: Best Female Hip Hop Artist Nominees Breakdown</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Coco Jones</h2></span><p>Last year, Coco Jones earned her first Best Actress nod at the BET Awards. This was thanks to her fabulous reimagination of Hilary Banks in Bel-Air. Jones has received widespread acclaim for her portrayal of the character. She has served to introduce the character to a new generation of viewers while maintaining the spunk of the original. Besides the Best Actress nod, Jones is also up for the 2023 BET Awards for Best New Artist and Best Female R&B/Pop Artist, due to <a href=# rel>her stellar year as a musician</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>2023 BET Awards: Best Male Hip Hop Artist Nominees</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Janelle James</h2></span><p>Janelle James has been making people laugh for decades, but her breakthrough role on <a href=# rel>Abbott Elementary</a> has been truly exceptional. James stars as Principal Ava in the comedy mockumentary, and her hilarious role has been constantly praised by fans and critics alike. 2023 marks James’ first Best Actress nomination at the BET Awards. As Abbott Elementary has already been renewed for a third season, there are probably a couple more nods for the actress in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>2023 BET Awards: A Look Into Nominees For Best Actor</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Janelle Monáe</h2></span><p>Janelle Monáe‘s first Best Actress nomination at the BET Awards came in 2017. Her brilliant performance in the biographical drama Hidden Figures was greatly praised. She lost the award to her co-star, Taraji P. Henson, but this year, she's up for the trophy once again for her performance in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. In the movie, Monáe won the audience and critics over by playing the role of twin sisters Helen and Andi. Her contrasting performance was a standout in the film.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel>2023 BET Awards: Best Female R&B/Pop Artist Nominees</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Keke Palmer</h2></span><p>Keke Palmer has received her first-ever Best Actress nomination at the 2023 BET Awards. This recognition comes as a result of her highly acclaimed role in the Jordan Peele horror, Nope. Palmer played Emerald Haywood, the curious, outspoken sister of OJ Haywood, played by Daniel Kaluuya. Their unique performances were praised, with Palmer singled out for her incredible talents on screen. Furthermore, her voice acting on the animated series Human Resources was also lauded and is also part of why she’s up for the trophy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>2023 BET Awards: Album Of The Year Nominees</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Viola Davis</h2></span><p>With seven nods for Best Actress, Viola Davis is one of the most nominated women in the history of the BET Awards. She won in 2012 for her roles in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, as well as The Help. Davis is one of the most awarded actresses of her generation. It’s no surprise that her performance in epic drama The Woman King has garnered yet another nod.&nbsp;</p><p>Davis worked tirelessly to get in warrior shape for her role in the film, and she completely knocked it out of the park. While she has earned nods for her acting in film, the bulk of her nominations are thanks to her stellar performance in the legal drama How to Get Away With Murder.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>2023 BET Awards: Best Movie Nominees</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zendaya</h2></span><p>Zendaya is currently the Best Actress holder at the BET Awards. Her win in 2022 came as a result of her gritty, emotional performance in the HBO teen drama, Euphoria. Coupled with that, her role in Spider-Man: No Way Home was also recognized. Although Euphoria has enjoyed its fair share of criticisms since its premiere, Zendaya’s acting has constantly been on the receiving end of praise.&nbsp;</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYVzhZVmmZ6sXZbEor7DrGRraGJoeqOx0q1kmpukp7K0vw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f688296-bet-awards-2023-best-actress.html&text=2023%20BET%20Awards%3a%20Best%20Actress%20Nominees&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f688296-bet-awards-2023-best-actress.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f688296-bet-awards-2023-best-actress.html&title=2023%20BET%20Awards%3a%20Best%20Actress%20Nominees" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f688296-bet-awards-2023-best-actress.html&title=2023%20BET%20Awards%3a%20Best%20Actress%20Nominees" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f688296-bet-awards-2023-best-actress.html&title=2023%20BET%20Awards%3a%20Best%20Actress%20Nominees" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f688296-bet-awards-2023-best-actress.html&description=2023%20BET%20Awards%3a%20Best%20Actress%20Nominees" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amy-correa-net-worth-63936.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amy Correa Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vector-tha-viper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vector tha Viper">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
