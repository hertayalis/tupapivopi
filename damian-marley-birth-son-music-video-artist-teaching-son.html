He was born on 21 July 1979. In Kingston, Jamaica. His mother is &nbsp;Cindy Breakspeare, Miss World 1976. Damian is her only child with Bob.</p><p>When&nbsp;Damian was only 2 years old, his father Bob Marley died and he was raised by his mother. His musical instincts were too much deep-rooted in his genes. So at the tender age of 13, he took up singing.</p><p>The 4 time Grammy award winner for Best Reggae Album and Best Urban/Alternative is in so state of stopping. He has been musically active since the early 1990s</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Damian-Marley-6.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=About_%E2%80%9CLiving_It_Up%E2%80%9D></span><span>About “Living It Up”</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Damian Marley published an official music video for his song “ Living It Up” on March 30, 2018, on YouTube.</p><p>The 6-and-a-half-minute song starts in Trenchtown, Jamaica. Damian can be seen taking his son to their original place. He explains the life there, culture, and homes. The dreadlocked star first explains grandfather Bob’s birthplace and where he lived as a child.</p><p>“we as very blessed you see. To be coming from these kind of places and living in, where we live now. We are very blessed”</p><p>He shows his son his old room.</p><p>“It’s you!” says his son pointing at the poster on the street.
