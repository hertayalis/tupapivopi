Singer, whose real name is Alecia Moore, met the motocross racer at the Summer X Games in Philadelphia in 2001, but their relationship was not smooth sailing. They briefly split in 2003 for one year, during which time Pink was linked to Tommy Lee, but neither of them has revealed the reason for their separation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/079ea3269371-pink-carey-hart-marriage.jpg><p id=eRGntbPTde1 data-wc=51>They rekindled their romance in 2004 and Pink proposed the following year during the Pro 250 class finals in Mammoth, California.

Carey told<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;People</a>: "We wanted it very fun and nontraditional. We're spiritual, but we're not religious.

She joked they were "due" for another.</p><h2 dir=ltr>How are Pink and Carey Hart making their marriage work?</h2><p id=e-5iGZx-bN8i data-wc=20>Pink has been very candid about <a class=hm-link href=#>seeking therapy</a> with Carey, with the couple crediting Vanessa Inn for saving their marriage.</p><p id=eG1f2WcNAouc data-wc=47>"It's the only reason that we're still together because you know, I think partners after a long time, we just speak.

We just wouldn't because we are not taught as kids how to have relationships, how to get along with people," the star told her Instagram followers.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCy-r0L-nkwH data-wc=32>Never one to shy away from the truth, Pink also admitted that they go through their fair share of ups and downs, but they "do the work" to make their relationship successful.</p><p id=ey2GlwEj9DW3 data-wc=53>"There are moments where I look at [Hart] and he is the most thoughtful, logical, constant … he’s like a rock. He’s a good man. He’s a good dad. He’s just the kind of dad I thought he’d be and then some," she said in an interview with The Guardian in October 2017.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7zNzCbgAwvX data-wc=39>"And then I’ll look at him and go: I’ve never liked you. There’s nothing I like about you. We have nothing in common. I don’t like any of the [expletive] you like. I don’t ever wanna see you again.</p><p id=e33rzGlkbskn data-wc=44>"Then two weeks later I’m like, things are going so good, you guys. Then you’ll go through times when you haven’t had sex in a year. Is this bed death? Is this the end of it? Do I want him? Does he want me?"&nbsp;</p><p id=eME1-i6bElac data-wc=14>Pink added: "Monogamy is work!
