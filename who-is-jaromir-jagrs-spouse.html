He returned to the NHL in 2011 with the Flyers and stayed in the league for another seven years before being swapped in 2018 by the Flames with HC Kladno. Having played 35 professional seasons (as of 2023) and over 2000 professional matches, he has enjoyed one of the longest careers in professional ice hockey history. He is the most productive European player to ever play in the NHL and is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time.</p><p>Jaromir Jágr has the second most points in NHL history, behind Wayne Gretzky. In 1990, at the age of 18, he was the youngest NHL player. Until the transfer, at 45 years old, he was the oldest player in the NHL and the oldest player to score a hat trick. In 2017, Jágr was named one of the 100 greatest NHL players in history.</p><p>Jaromir Jágr was the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL Draft. He won the Stanley Cup consecutively in the 1991 and 1992 seasons with the Penguins. Personally, he has won the Art Ross Trophy as a five-time NHL scoring champion (four times in a row), the Lester B. Pearson Award for Outstanding NHL Player by the NHL Players Association (AJLNH) voted three times and the Hart Memorial Wins the title as the tournament’s most valuable player once, while finishing second four times.</p><p>Jaromir Jágr is a member of the Golden Triple Club, an individual who has played for teams that have won the Stanley Cup (1991, 1992), the Ice Hockey World Championships (2005, 2010), and Olympic gold medals in ice hockey (1998). Jágr is one of only two Czech players (the other being Jiří Šlégr) at the club to achieve this feat in 2005.</p><p>JaromirJágr was the flag bearer for the Czech Republic at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Jágr was also one of only three players from 1981 to 2001 to win the Art Ross Trophy as the top scorer, best of the season; the others are Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. Jágr has won the prize more times than any other non-Canadian player. He is a member of the Czech Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.</p><p>Jágr is second in NHL career regular-season points and is sixth in career playoff points. He is also amongst the career leaders in several other major NHL regular season statistical categories: goals (4th), assists (5th), games played (4th), overtime goals (T-2nd), game-winning goals (1st), even-strength goals (3rd), power-play goals (T-11th), points per game (20th) and shots on goal (3rd).</p><p>Also amongst all-time leaders in NHL playoff statistical categories, Jágr ranks in the top 20 in points (6th), goals (11th), assists (10th), overtime goals (T-6th), game-winning goals (10th), games played (T-15th), power-play goals (T-19th) and shots on goal (6th).</p><p>Jaromir Jágr’s longevity in the NHL has spawned a fan club known as “The Traveling Jagrs”, a group of hockey fans from the Alberta cities of Calgary and Camrose who share an interest in the player. The group dresses in the sweater, hockey socks, and pant shells of 11 of Jágr’s teams (his nine NHL teams, the NHL All-Star team, and the Czech national team) plus long black wigs in reference to Jágr’s traditional hairstyle.</p><p>Usually, the club would travel once or twice a year to see him play in person, but after Jágr signed with the Flames, they announced that they would be a more regular fixture at games.</p><p>Jaromir Jagr started skating at the age of three and immediately showed exceptional abilities. At the age of 15, he played in the top division in Czechoslovakia for Poldi SONP Kladno, and at the age of 17 he became the youngest member of the Czechoslovak national team. As a young man, in his homeland, he kept a photo of US President Ronald Reagan in his notebook, as a protest against Soviet policies.</p><p>Jágr was the first Czechoslovakian player selected by the NHL without having to defect to the West first; His pick in the NHL Draft comes as the Iron Curtain falls. Because of this, after Jágr was picked by the Pittsburgh Penguins with a fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL Draft, he was able to immediately move to North America from Czechoslovakia. While on the draft in Vancouver, he was the first Czechoslovak player to appear in the NHL draft with government approval.</p><p>In 806 games against Pittsburgh, Jaromir Jágr became the second player (after Lemieux) to hit 1,000 points as a Penguin. Jágr is second to Lemieux in career goals in franchise history and third in terms of games played, assists, and points, the latter being surpassed by Sidney Crosby.</p><p>Then in 2001, the Capitals signed Jágr the largest contract in NHL history for $77 million over seven years, with an average annual value of $11 million, with an option for an eighth year. However, Jágr failed to live up to expectations in Washington, as the Capitals failed to defend their championship and missed the 2002 Stanley Cup Qualifiers.</p><p>For the first time in his tenure with the Capitals, Jágr did not make it to the NHL’s top scorers list, help his team qualify for the Stanley Cup knockout stages, or become the NHL All-Star Team. In the summer of 2002, the Capitals reunited Jágr with former teammate Robert Lang. In 2002–03, Washington finished sixth in the Eastern Conference but lost to Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round of the 2003 knockout despite winning the first two games of the series.</p><p>Because the new CBA was signed before the start of the 2005–06 season, Jágr’s salary was reduced to $7.8 million, the maximum allowed under the new salary. During the NHL labor dispute in 2004-2005, he played for HC Kladno in the Czech Republic, then for Avangard Omsk in the Russian league (RSL).</p><p>Jágr led the Czech Republic to a gold medal at the 2005 World Hockey Championships in Austria and was named the tournament’s star player. He also became a member of the prestigious Triple Gold Hockey Club, whose players have won the Stanley Cup, the Hockey World Championship, and the Olympic gold medal.</p><p>On 3 July 2008, for the first time in his career, Jágr, an unrestricted free agent, was told by Rangers general manager Glen Sather that the club would not offer him a new contract. Sather admitted that the two sides had never negotiated the details of a new contract and, after months of speculation, Jágr was “seriously considering” going to Russia to end his career, despite the offers from NHL teams.</p><p>Jaromir Jágr has expressed his wish to finish his career at his father’s club HC Kladno. On July 4, Jágr agreed to a two-year contract with Avangard Omsk of the Continental Hockey League (KHL); the contract will pay Jágr the equivalent of US$5 million annually.</p><p>On July 1, 2011, Jágr returned to the NHL, but instead of signing with his original NHL team in Pittsburgh, he signed a one-year, $3.3 million contract with the Philadelphia Flyers, Penguin’s interstate rivalries. He scored his 1,600th NHL point in his first game with the Flyers, assisting Claude Giroux in scoring as the Flyers won their opening game of the season 2-1 over the Boston Bruins on the 6th of October 2011.</p><p>Usually playing up front with Giroux and Scott Hartnell, Jágr was among the top scorers at the start of the 2011–12 season. He scored his first and second goals as a Flyer on October 24 against the Toronto Maple Leafs. On October 29, 2011, against Hurricane Carolina, he scored his 650th and 651st NHL goals. He scored his only goal in the 2012 playoffs in Philadelphia’s series against Pittsburgh. The Flyers were eliminated by the New Jersey Devils, who would eventually become champions of the 2012 Eastern Conference.</p><p>On July 22, 2013, Jágr signed a one-year contract with the New Jersey Devils; The contract includes a guaranteed $2 million and an additional $2 million in incentive bonuses if Jágr plays at least 40 games. Jágr, 41, hopes to help the Devils get through the loss of Ilya Kovalchuk, who previously left KHL. Jágr scored his first goal as a Devil on 7 October 2013 in a 5–4 penalty shootout loss to Edmonton Oilers. The goal came on the 23rd anniversary of his first NHL goal, coincidentally, against the Devils.</p><p>On February 26, 2015, Jágr was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2015 NHL Draft and a third-round pick in 2016. He made his team debut on February 28 in the Panthers’ 5–3 win over Buffalo Sabres and scored his first point for the team in the next game on March 1, scoring one goal and one assist ​created in a 4–3 win over Tampa.</p><p>On March 19, Jágr scored his 718th career goal against Detroit to overtake Phil Esposito and rank 5th on the all-time scoring list. In the Panthers’ 4-2 win over the Bruins on April 9, Jágr scored two assists to give him 1,800 career NHL points and is the only man to own a fourth-place finish on the all-time scoreboard, surpassing former Penguins teammate Ron Francis.</p><p>On 3 February 2018, Jágr played his first game for his hometown team and his first game since 31 December 2017, he played almost 20 minutes and provided 3 assists. In his fifth game for Kladno, he picked up an injury and was sidelined for the rest of the season with a knee injury. To qualify for the knockout final, he played a few seconds in ten knockouts. On May 14, Jágr announced his intention to stay with Kladno for his 30th professional season. On 19 April, Jágr scored four goals in one game as Kladno was promoted to the Czech Premier League.</p><p>The 2022–23 season marks Jágr’s 35th consecutive professional ice hockey season and in February 2023 he scored his 1,100th professional goal. Jágr said his biggest fear in retirement is driving away sponsors and jeopardizing Kladno’s viability as a team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Jaromir Jagr’s relationship status?</h2><p>Jaromir Jagr isn’t married and has never been married according to our research but is currently in a relationship with Czech model Dominika Branisova.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqrrdGopKKqXZ%2BuqL7SZqqpp6WosnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jaromir-jagrs-spouse.html&text=Who%20is%20Jaromir%20Jagrs%20Spouse%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jaromir-jagrs-spouse.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jaromir-jagrs-spouse.html&title=Who%20is%20Jaromir%20Jagrs%20Spouse%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-jaromir-jagrs-spouse.html&title=Who%20is%20Jaromir%20Jagrs%20Spouse%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jaromir-jagrs-spouse.html&title=Who%20is%20Jaromir%20Jagrs%20Spouse%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jaromir-jagrs-spouse.html&description=Who%20is%20Jaromir%20Jagrs%20Spouse%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bruce-springsteen-health.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bruce Springsteen's Health Is Declining  Will He Go Back on Tour?
