There are solid wood and composite options that run $4 to $5 per square foot.</span></span><h2>What is the cheapest type of decking?</h2>Pressure-Treated Lumber Costs<p>It's the most common and least expensive type of decking.</p><h2>What is the cheapest material to build a deck with?</h2>Pressure-treated wood is generally the cheapest material to build decks from.<h2>How much does it cost to build a 20x20 deck?</h2>The average homeowner spends $2,200 to build a 10x10 foot deck, $6,160 to build a 14x20 deck, and $8,800 to build a 20x20 deck. The cost to build a deck with pressure-treated wood, hardwood, or composite is about $25 per square foot, for both materials and installation.<h2>What is the most maintenance free deck?</h2>Modern, low-maintenance deck products like vinyl have become the material of choice for homeowners who don't want to spend time and money maintaining a wood deck. Wood decks need to be sanded and either painted or stained every few years to keep the wood from deteriorating.<h2>The cheapest deck in the history of Clash Royale</h2><p></p><h2>Is PVC decking cheaper than composite?</h2>PVC is much harder and more scratch resistant than composite decking, which is good news if you have a large dog or heavy patio furniture. All these benefits don't come cheap, however: PVC decking will cost you about $10 per sq. ft. Some companies offer a limited lifetime warranty.<h2>Is PVC decking more expensive than composite decking?</h2>Composite decking is typically more expensive. As mentioned, the quality and color choices and whether grooved or not, make a difference in the price. This chart is provided as an idea of the price differences between PVC and composite decking. Many factors, including your location, will affect the cost of deck boards.<h2>Is composite decking cheaper than wood?</h2>If you're on a budget and the price tag of a composite deck is just too much, then a wooden deck is a great alternative. The lowest cost per square foot for a pressure treated pine deck sells for about half the price of composite, $25 versus $30 installation, respectively.<h2>How much does Trex cost per foot?</h2>Trex Decking Cost Per Square Foot<p>The materials cost for a Trex deck with substructure, decking and fasteners included, generally falls into the range of $9 to $16 per square foot. Options and the materials grade, however, can push this total as high as $30 per square foot.</p><h2>Is it cheaper to build your own deck?</h2>According to Remodeling magazine's 2021 Cost vs. Value report, on average, a homeowner can recoup around 63% of the cost of a composite deck or almost 66% of the cost of a wood deck. Why? Because home buyers are willing to pay top dollar to own a deck.<h2>How can I get cheap decking?</h2><p>Cheaper alternatives to decking</p><li>Gravel. Most people don't consider gravel as an option but it can be a good alternative. ...</li><li>Paving. ...</li><li>Rubber mats. ...</li><li>Poured concrete. ...</li><li>Pallet decking. ...</li><li>Bark chippings. ...</li><li>Self binding gravel. ...</li><li>DIY decking kits.</li><h2>How much does it cost for a Trex deck?</h2>Trex Decking Cost<p>Trex decking costs $1,600 to $9,600, averaging about $4,800. That's $5 to $12 per square foot for just decking boards and $5 to $15 per square foot for installation. Size is the biggest price factor, with 144 square feet ranging from $1,440 to $3,900 compared to $3,000 to $8,100 for 300 square feet.</p><h2>Is there a cheaper alternative to Trex decking?</h2>Generally speaking, Trex and Fiberon offer the least expensive options while TimberTech and AZEK come in on the higher end. However, keep in mind that the higher-tiered grades of Trex are more expensive than the lower-tiered grades of Timbertech so it's important to make sure you're comparing apples to apples.<h2>Does Trex cost more than wood?</h2>Trex Decking can be slightly more pricey than wood decking, depending on the features you choose. A Trex deck costs on average $5 to $12 per square foot, compared to wood decking which costs $3 to $7 per square foot. Pressure treated wood will be more expensive, costing between $6 and $14 per square foot.<h2>Is PVC decking more expensive than wood?</h2>Composite decking initially will cost more than wood decking, generally in the range of 3 to 6 times compared to pressure-treated decking. Over the life of your deck, composite decking has lower maintenance costs, and longevity makes it a more cost-effective long-term option.<h2>Which is cheaper Trex or azek?</h2>There's no getting around this one—Trex and Azek decking is significantly more expensive than traditional wood decking. Price out Azek decking vs Trex for an identical project, and you'll quickly find Trex is the cheaper option, with Azek coming in at 2 to 3 times the cost, per linear board foot, of Trex.<h2>What are the disadvantages of Trex decking?</h2><p>CONS OF COMPOSITE DECKING</p><ul><li>The cost of composite decking boards can be higher initially. ...</li><li>Surface damage can be an issue in some cases. ...</li><li>Composite deck surfaces can be more slippery. ...</li><li>The surface of composite decking may be warmer than wood planks. ...</li><li>If you prefer the look of real wood, composite isn't for you.</li></ul><h2>Is TimberTech cheaper than wood?</h2>TimberTech decks are a more eco-friendly choice compared to normal deck building. Hardwood decking usually costs 1.25 trees for a single deck. In contrast, TimberTech boards crafted from recycled woods and plastics present no damage to real wood.<h2>Is Trex decking worth the money?</h2>Trex decks are worth it because you get what you pay for. They cost more than a treated lumber one, making up for your extra outlay of cash at the onset, and will last for years longer than the average treated deck, letting you more than recoup your investment. Trex decks are also low maintenance.<h2>Is Trex cheaper than cedar?</h2>Unlike pressure-treated wood that is cheaper than Trex decking, cedar is not. If you are buying quality cedar, you will be paying almost as much as Trex. Which with regular maintenance will only increase. A cedar deck will save you no more than a Trex deck, which in time will be cheaper.<h2>What are the problems with PVC decking?</h2>Certain PVC decking products are prone to peeling, staining, deteriorating, and mold accumulation after relatively short periods of time. Some of the PVC decking subject to these complaints is manufactured by AZEC, TimberTech, and Wolf Home Products.<h2>Is a PVC deck worth it?</h2>Cellular PVC decking is the highest quality option, and despite its high initial cost, it provides the greatest value over time. It avoids the mold, insect, and warping potential that wood and composites have, and has even greater fading and scratch protection to help maintain its value over time.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6tbTEZqOemaOpeqbEz56lrKGmmnqlscKkZKaZpJq%2Fqq3L</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-least-expensive-deck-material.html&text=What%20is%20the%20least%20expensive%20deck%20material%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-least-expensive-deck-material.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-least-expensive-deck-material.html&title=What%20is%20the%20least%20expensive%20deck%20material%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-the-least-expensive-deck-material.html&title=What%20is%20the%20least%20expensive%20deck%20material%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-least-expensive-deck-material.html&title=What%20is%20the%20least%20expensive%20deck%20material%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-least-expensive-deck-material.html&description=What%20is%20the%20least%20expensive%20deck%20material%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-hannah-herrier-from-below-deck-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is Hannah Ferrier from Below Deck now?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kim-petras-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is &amp;quot;Unholy&amp;quot; Singer Kim Petras' Net Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
