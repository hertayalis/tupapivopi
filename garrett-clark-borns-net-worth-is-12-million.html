He is best known for his single “Electric Love”, which has been certified platinum in both the US and Canada. Børns has released two studio albums – “Dopamine” and “Blue Madonna”. His active involvement in the entertainment industry dates back to 2010.</p><p>Reporting from authoritative sources indicates that Børns’ net worth is $12 million, as of the data presented at the beginning of 2018. Music is the primary source of his fortune.</p><h3>Børns Net Worth $12 million</h3><p>Originating from Grand Haven, Michigan, Børns developed an interest in art during his upbringing. At the age of 10, he became a professional magician under the pseudonym Garrett the Great. Børns won the Gold Key Award at the National Scholastic Art Award when he was 13, while studying at White Pines Middle School. This achievement earned him a scholarship of $8,000 to Kendall College of Art and Design, part of the state university of Ferris State University.</p><p>Commencing his musical career, Børns participated in the TEDx program, showcasing his talent with a ukulele. In 2013, he relocated from New York to Los Angeles and quickly established a home there. Within a few weeks of moving, Børns composed the single “10,000 Emerald Pools”, co-created with Jack Kennedy. His success in the fashion industry also became apparent when Gucci noticed him after a performance on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” and offered him a collaboration. Børns also became a prominent figure in the gender-identity movement, advocating for nail polish and crop-tops through social media, which significantly diversified and enhanced his potential net worth.</p><p>The artist acknowledges that his androgynous voice and appearance often caused confusion, with many people mistaking him for a woman. Towards the end of 2014, he released the debut single “10,000 Emerald Pools” under Interscope Records, along with the debut EP “Candy”. Børns then appeared on various television and talk shows, including “Conan” and “Le Before du Grand Journal” in France. He began performing live as a supporting act for Mister Wives on their tour titled “Our Own House Tour”, before the release of his debut studio album “Dopamine” in 2015. The album reached second place on the Billboard Alt and Rock charts. In the middle of the same year, he headlined at the Electrowerkz club in London, and later accompanied Charli XCX and Bleachers on their “Charli and Jack Do America Tour”, including a performance at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago. Børns also made appearances at “Life Is Beautiful” and “Austin City Limits Music Festival”. In 2016, he performed at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York, a performance that was recorded by the American Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) for nationwide broadcast. That same year, he also performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. At the beginning of 2018, Børns released his second studio album – “Blue Madonna” – which contained the singles “Faded Heart”, “Sweet Dreams”, and “God Save Our Young Blood”, reaching third place on the Billboard Alt chart.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Børns is currently single, although singer Zella Day is known to be a close friend.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiemqqimsG1ecKlmKujXZe8s7rSZqWerF2svLPAx2agrGVhZ3qutculoKimXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgarrett-clark-borns-net-worth-is-12-million.html&text=Garrett%20Clark%20Brns%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20%2412%20million&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgarrett-clark-borns-net-worth-is-12-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgarrett-clark-borns-net-worth-is-12-million.html&title=Garrett%20Clark%20Brns%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20%2412%20million" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgarrett-clark-borns-net-worth-is-12-million.html&title=Garrett%20Clark%20Brns%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20%2412%20million" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgarrett-clark-borns-net-worth-is-12-million.html&title=Garrett%20Clark%20Brns%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20%2412%20million" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgarrett-clark-borns-net-worth-is-12-million.html&description=Garrett%20Clark%20Brns%20Net%20Worth%20Is%20%2412%20million" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mariah-carey-dons-unflattering-swimsuit-talks-about-abuse-in-her-past.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mariah Carey dons unflattering swimsuit, talks about abuse in her past">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./do-squid-go-blind.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Do squid go blind?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
