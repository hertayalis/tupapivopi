&nbsp;|&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-user"></i>&nbsp;Martina Birk</span></p><div class=post-entry>Raleigh authorities are conducting an investigation into an unsettling event that led to a brief lockdown at Crabtree Valley Mall on Friday morning. Police responded to reports of shots fired at approximately 10:07 a.m. at the mall located on 4325 Glenwood Avenue.
Upon arrival, law enforcement and mall security swiftly determined that no shots were discharged, and thankfully, no injuries were reported. The confusion stemmed from a small group of Pro-Palestinian protesters within the mall premises, creating a commotion that startled shoppers, causing them to rush towards the exits.

But, when talented Hail, Caesar! actor&nbsp;Alden Ehrenreich landed the highly coveted role, a lot of people softened their stance a little.
Ehrenreich has previously spoken about the audition&nbsp;process, but during a new interview with Variety, the 26-year-old praises his co-star Donald Glover &nbsp;(who was recently cast as a younger Lando Calrissian) and confirms that the film will also feature a younger, though not a whole lot shorter, take on Chewie.
