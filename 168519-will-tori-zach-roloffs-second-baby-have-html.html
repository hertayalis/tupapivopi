However, Tori revealed that fans might have to wait a bit more to discover that.</p><p class=Xg>Fans of TLC’s “Little People, Big World” watched Zach Roloff, the only son of Amy and Matt Roloff born with dwarfism, go from a shy teenager to a grown man that has his own family</p><p class=Xg>The now 29-year-old soccer coach married <a class="ie l" href=#>Tori Roloff</a> in 2015 in a sweet “country chic” ceremony that took place on Roloff Farms, where the couple initially met.</p><p class=Xg>A year later, when Tori and Zack decided to have children, they knew that their kids had a 50/50 chance of inheriting the dwarfism gene. Still, they wanted to start a family and promised to love their kids in whatever form they “popped out.”</p><p><h3 class=bh><strong class=Vg>JACKSON'S BIRTH</strong></h3></p><p class=Xg>Jackson Roloff, also known as Baby J, was born in May 2017 and diagnosed with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. Zach was also born with it.</p><p class=Xg>Tori and Zach found out about Jackson’s big chances of being born with dwarfisms when she was on her 34 weeks of pregnancy, thanks to an ultrasound. And although they <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/little-people-big-world-zach-tori-roloff-baby-boy-jackson/>shared the news</a> with the family, they kept fans out of the loop until baby J was born.</p><p class=Xg>“We knew our chances of having a dwarf, but it didn’t matter,” <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/little-people-big-world-zach-tori-roloff-baby-boy-jackson/>said</a> Tori. “We just knew we wanted to be parents; however God wanted it to happen.”</p><p class=Xg>Zach, on the other hand, said he was excited about his son being just like him instead of having an average stature.</p><p class=Xg>“He came in as an LP. He’s an achon, so he’s just like me. We’re super excited for it. We’ll hope just to give him a healthy, happy life and support him in every way,” he <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tlcme.com/inside-tlc/zach-and-tori-introduce-baby-jackson>said</a> in a blog for TLC.</p><p class=Xg>“Hopefully he can experience as much of the world as Tori, and I have been able to and hopefully much more. He may have to take two steps for everyone else’s one step, but hopefully, we’ll be able to raise him in a way where that won’t stop him.”</p><p><h3 class=bh><strong class=Vg>BABY NUMBER TWO ON THE WAY</strong></h3></p><p class=Xg>Last May, <a class="ie l" href=#>Tori and Zach</a> announced they're expecting their second child, a baby girl, in November.</p><p class=Xg>Since then, the mom-to-be has been sharing updates on her pregnancy, which she revealed has been harder than her first one.</p><p class=Xg>“I have had a harder time accepting my body this go around,” the kindergarten teacher <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzl1Didppqj/>wrote on an honest Instagram post</a>. “I’ve gotten bigger a lot faster than I did with Jackson and I’ve become a lot more insecure. It’s been hard to really enjoy this pregnancy because I’ve let my own body image issues get in the way.”</p><p class=Xg><a class="ie l" href=#>Tori</a> also revealed that she didn’t felt like taking maternity pics, but her family convinced her, and the result is beautiful, something she feels grateful for.</p><p><h3 class=bh><strong class=Vg>WILL THE GIRL ALSO HAVE DWARFISM?</strong></h3></p><p class=Xg>Like her brother Jackson, the baby girl on the way has a 50/50 chance of being born with dwarfism, because the gene is a dominant one.</p><p class=Xg>Although Tori and Zach chose to know beforehand if their first child would be born as a little person, this time around they’re hanging onto the mystery until the baby is born, as Tori <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://thestir.cafemom.com/celebrity_moms/220427/tori-roloff-second-child-dwarfism/303501/what_a_perfect_response/5>explained</a> in her Instagram stories last month:</p><p class=Xg>“We can [know] by now through an amniotic draw, but Zach and I opted out of that just because we don't care either way. We love her, and we can't wait to meet her.”</p><p class=Xg>“They do track dwarfism from 24 weeks to like 32-ish weeks,” the reality star mom <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://thestir.cafemom.com/celebrity_moms/220427/tori-roloff-second-child-dwarfism/303501/what_a_perfect_response/5>continued</a>. “That's when we found out with Jackson, but it's never a diagnosis until they're born."</p><p><h3 class=bh><strong class=Vg>TORI’S FEARS BEFORE JACKSON WAS BORN</strong></h3></p><p class=Xg>On “Little People, Big World,” fans got to witness Tori voicing her concerns about having a child with dwarfism before Jackson was born.</p><p class=Xg>She explained that no parent wants to hear that their child is different—to which Zach pointed out if the baby was born a dwarf, it would be unusual for her, not for him. On top of that, kids with <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.genome.gov/Genetic-Disorders/Achondroplasia>achondroplasia</a> can have several <a class="ie l" href=#>health issues</a> along the way.</p><p class=Xg>Zach, for example, went through several surgeries and faced many complications growing up.</p><p class=Xg>“If you didn’t know anything about dwarfism and you found out your child was a dwarf, that would be scary,” Tori said. “There are certain things that come along with having an achondroplasia child that would be more difficult than having a child that was average height.”</p><p class=Xg>“The world is changing. People are more open to diversity. Whatever he wants to do, we’re going to find a way to help him do it. That’s our job in life now … it’s part of the whole package of who he is. He’s happy and healthy. That’s all that matters,” Zach <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/little-people-big-world-zach-roloff-childhood-baby-jackson-dwarfism/>told People of Jackson</a>.</p><p class=Xg>We’re sure the same will apply for their future baby girl. No matter if she’s born with dwarfism or not, the Roloff family will love her and support her the same.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmptcW1hbnq4tculZK2nop56u63CoWSrp5yks6e%2FjKycnKeemXqjrcGyZKGZppp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f168519-will-tori-zach-roloffs-second-baby-have-html.html&text=We%20Don%27t%20Care%20Either%20Way&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f168519-will-tori-zach-roloffs-second-baby-have-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f168519-will-tori-zach-roloffs-second-baby-have-html.html&title=We%20Don%27t%20Care%20Either%20Way" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f168519-will-tori-zach-roloffs-second-baby-have-html.html&title=We%20Don%27t%20Care%20Either%20Way" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f168519-will-tori-zach-roloffs-second-baby-have-html.html&title=We%20Don%27t%20Care%20Either%20Way" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f168519-will-tori-zach-roloffs-second-baby-have-html.html&description=We%20Don%27t%20Care%20Either%20Way" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./976-evil-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Deftones                                          976-EVIL lyrics        ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./john-travolta-daughter-ella-kelly-preston-birthday-tribute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Travolta &amp;amp; daughter Ella's emotional tributes to Kelly Preston on 61st birthday">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
