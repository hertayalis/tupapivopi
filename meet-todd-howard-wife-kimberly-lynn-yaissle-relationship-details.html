Howard is the director and executive producer at Bethesda Game Studios at present.</strong></p><p>Additionally, Howard was appointed as a producer in 1994. Similarly, Todd was credited initially as the producer and designer of The Terminator: Future Shock.</p><p>Tood was also the project supervisor for the 1998 release of The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard.</p><p>Two years later, he was designated project supervisor and designer for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.</p><p>The designer of video games is best known for his lengthy and prosperous career. He directed the creation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006) as an executive producer.</p><p>People are also concerned about his personal life, including his marital status, in addition to his career.</p><h2>Kimberly Lynn Yaissle is Todd Howard’s wife</h2><p>Kimberly Lynn Yaissle is Todd Howard’s fiancée. For many years, the couple has shared the close bond of husband and wife. They are doing well, and their marriage continues to flourish.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yaissle prefers to avoid contact with the media. Due to Kimberly’s low-key personality, media sources have been unable to provide details about her life.</p><p>Additionally, some online sources assert that she graduated from the University of Richmond.</p><p>According to rumors, Yaissle and her spouse Howard are high school sweethearts, having graduated from Emmaus High School together.</p><p>Kimberly is purported to be a graduate of the University of Richmond with a degree in elementary education.</p><p>In addition, Kimberly lacks official social media accounts, making it difficult to learn about her current life.</p><p>It is believed that Kimberly and her beloved husband, Todd Howard, are leading a happy existence.</p><h2>Todd Howard and Kimberly Lynn Yaissle Relationship</h2><p>Todd Howard and his wife, Kimberly Lynn Yaissle, have shared a long-standing affectionate relationship. As stated previously, both individuals avoid media prominence.</p><p>Due to this, it is impossible to pinpoint when the couple initiated their romantic relationship. As mentioned previously, Howard and Yaissle are reportedly Emmaus High School alumni.</p><p>Given this information, it’s possible that Howard and Yaissle began dating in high school. After some time, the couple contemplated advancing their beautiful relationship.</p><p>So, Todd and Kimberly ultimately became husband and wife on July 8, 1995, following a private wedding ceremony. Their wedding ceremony took place at St.</p><p>Thomas More Catholic Church’s headquarters are located in Allentown, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Deborah A. Yaissle was the lady of honor for her sister’s wedding, and Jeffrey Mark Howard, the sibling of the groom, was the best man.</p><p>Since then, the beautiful couple has been inseparable.</p><p>Todd Howard has been married for many years, and he and his wife have begun their own family. The married couple had two children, two males named Luke and Jake.</p><p>The family of four lives contentedly in seclusion, and very little information is available about them. During an interview, Howard once discussed his wife and children.</p><p>Aside from that, Howard’s familial heritage is excellent, as he was born to supportive parents in 1970. Ronald (Ron) and Priscilla Howard brought him up in Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania, United States.</p><p>In addition, Howard was raised alongside his older sibling, Jeffrey Mark (Jeff) Howard. According to reports, his brother also works in the same profession as Todd.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Who Is Katie Leung Currently Dating?
