What happened to his parents?</strong></p><p>Josh Butler is a television actor, TikTok star, and former athlete, who is popular for his @<a href=# rel=noopener>joshbutlertv </a>account on the video-sharing platform.&nbsp;</p><p>With over 2.1 million followers and 72.1 million likes, he is known for sharing comedy, vlog, and football videos. His two adorable pets also make regular appearances on his TikTok videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Butler attended West Mesquite High School and is a graduate of Michigan State University. He was a top-ranked cornerback in the country when he was in high school. ESPN listed him among Midland's top prospects.&nbsp;</p><p>He recorded a career-high 25 tackles and tied for second on the team with a career-high five pass break-ups in playing all 13 games during his senior season in Michigan State.&nbsp;</p><p>As of now, he has entered the television world and is seen on season 3 of All Americans.&nbsp;</p><a title=@joshbutlertv href=#>@joshbutlertv</a> Super stars @Kai Gaines üé• üê∂ü§†üê∂ <a title=joshbutlertv href=#>#joshbutlertv</a> <a title=roxyandremi href=#>#roxyandremi</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a> <a title=comedy href=#>#comedy</a> <a title=dogs href=#>#dogs</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=memes href=#>#memes</a> <a title="‚ô¨ Super Gremlin - Kodak Black" href=#>‚ô¨ Super Gremlin - Kodak Black</a><h2 id=nfl-who-are-josh-butler-p>NFL: Who Are Josh Butler Parents? Father Steven And Mother Ladrida</h2><p>He has the saddest story that no person should ever go through. Both of Josh Butler's died when he was in college.</p><p>His father, Steven Butler, passed away due to a heart attack in 2017. The former cornerback was not even over his father's death when he lost his mother one and a half years later.</p><p>Ladrida Butler, his mother, was diagnosed with breast cancer and died of its complication, as per <a href=# rel=noopener>CBS Sports</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Josh adopted two dogs, Roxy and Remi, to cope with the loss of his parents. It is probably why he shares a really close bond with his pets.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, parents accompany their children on the football field for senior day. However, Josh took his dogs on the field in the absence of his family.&nbsp;</p><p>He also thanked his coach for allowing him to take them out on the field via his Twitter account. He concluded the post by remembering his mother and father.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Senior Day! üíöüôèüèæ Thank you Coach D for allowing <a href=#>@Roxy_RemiTv</a> to walk with me.

Now, he is an actor and a popular social media star.</p><p>His Instagram and Twitter have amassed more than 77K and 10.3K followers, where he often collaborates with various brands.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, he may have collected a sound net worth from his career.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=is-josh-butler-married-wi>Is Josh Butler Married? Wife & Children&nbsp;</h2><p>Josh Butler is not married so the question about his wife and children goes out of the picture.</p><p>Also, it's uncertain if Butler has a girlfriend. The All Americans actor has not introduced his partner on social media and has kept his romantic life under wraps currently.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout his career, he has not been linked with any possible romantic partners as well, so it's safe to assume he is not in a relationship right now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiln6RdrLWwecCrnGain6i1bq7UraOeql2lrrOxza2q</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnfl-who-are-josh-butler-parents.html&text=NFL%3a%20Who%20Are%20Josh%20Butler%20Parents%3f%20Father%20Steven%20And%20Mother%20Ladrida%20-What%20Happened%20To%20Them%3f%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnfl-who-are-josh-butler-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnfl-who-are-josh-butler-parents.html&title=NFL%3a%20Who%20Are%20Josh%20Butler%20Parents%3f%20Father%20Steven%20And%20Mother%20Ladrida%20-What%20Happened%20To%20Them%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnfl-who-are-josh-butler-parents.html&title=NFL%3a%20Who%20Are%20Josh%20Butler%20Parents%3f%20Father%20Steven%20And%20Mother%20Ladrida%20-What%20Happened%20To%20Them%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnfl-who-are-josh-butler-parents.html&title=NFL%3a%20Who%20Are%20Josh%20Butler%20Parents%3f%20Father%20Steven%20And%20Mother%20Ladrida%20-What%20Happened%20To%20Them%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnfl-who-are-josh-butler-parents.html&description=NFL%3a%20Who%20Are%20Josh%20Butler%20Parents%3f%20Father%20Steven%20And%20Mother%20Ladrida%20-What%20Happened%20To%20Them%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./review-desperation-road-walks-a-dark-path-but-the-southern-noir-thriller-never-forgets-theres-always-a-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Review: Desperation Road walks a dark path, but the Southern noir thriller never forgets there">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-talk-to-someone-you-cant-stand.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Talk to Someone You Can't Stand">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
