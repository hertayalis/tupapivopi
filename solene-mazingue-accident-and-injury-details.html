We can assume that in the near future, she will amass more followers as Solene is still young and has much time to leave a mark and gain popularity. &nbsp; While talking about her Instagram account, she also has a Twitter account @<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SoleneMazingue</a>, with only 40 followers. &nbsp; It seems like she is not quite active on Twitter. But as mentioned above, there is no doubt that she will gain many followers on her social media platforms as she rises and gain success, drawing attention toward her.<h2><strong>Solene Mazingue Health Update</strong></h2><p>Gaidajenko fell while practicing lifting Mazingue in October 2022. Mazingue fractured her skull and experienced intracranial hemorrhage after hitting her head on the ice. She required immediate hospitalization.</p><p>The injury was so bad that physiotherapy took months to heal. In January 2023, Mazingue finally received permission to return to the ice when she started crying.</p><p>She experienced a range of feelings, not the least of which was whether she would ever compete again.</p><p>She still hopes to win the Olympics, possibly in Paris the following year. So, to compete at the World Championships in March 2023, she traveled to Japan with her boyfriend Gaidajenko.</p><p>Solene has recovered and doing well as of now. Thinking about the injury was very scary, but her determination was too strong, and she kept fighting, which is one of the key factors that helped her recover soon.</p><p>As she mentioned, nothing is impossible until and unless you have the will to fight for something.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p>Read more:<a href=# rel=bookmark>What Happened To Austin Harrouff – Where Is He Now?
