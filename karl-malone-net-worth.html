Karl was a basketball player. a power forward now retired, also known under his nickname of the Mailman, earned for his consistent playing including scoring points. Malone was active in the NBA between 1985 and 2004, playing all but his last season with the Utah Jazz.</p><p>So just how rich is Karl Malone? Sources estimate that his current net worth is $75 million; he accumulated $104 million from his salary alone, experiencing his best year for earnings in 2002-2003 when the Utah Jazz paid him $19.2 million.</p><h3>Karl Malone Net Worth $75 Million</h3><p>Karl Malone attended the local Summerfield High School, and lead them to three state basketball titles. Obviously this brought him to the notice of several colleges, and Arkansas University, attempted to persuade him to join them, but Malone opted for Louisiana Tech University because it was closer to his home. In his second year Karl joined the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball team, which finished the 1984-85 top of the Southland Conference, and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time in the college’s history. Karl was an All-Southland selection in all of his three years with the Bulldogs.</p><p>Karl Malone was picked 13th by the Utah Jazz in the 1985 NBA Draft, and won selection to the All-Rookie NBA team that season. He continued to improve steadily, such that he was selected in 14 NBA All-Star games – twice being the MVP – and was twice voted the MVP in the NBA for the entire season. Karl finished his time with the Jazz as their all-time leading scorer, with a career average of 25 points per game, and total points which put him second on the NBA all-time list. Malone and the team never won a championship, but consistently won the Western Conference to enter the play-offs, and did make the NBA Finals series in 1997, only to lose to the Michael Jordan-lead Chicago Bulls. Of course, these seasons with the Utah Jazz were extremely beneficial for Karl Malone’ net worth.</p><p>Regretfully, it was a similar story in 2004 with&nbsp; the Los Angeles Lakers, who he joined with the specific goal of winning a championship, but the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the Finals series.</p><p>Karl’s last few years were marred by serious knee injuries, especially in his last season, but he still contributed significantly to both his teams’ efforts. After his season with the Lakers, Malone became a free agent. He had knee surgery during the summer of 2004, and personal problems with Lakers guard Kobe Bryant prompted Malone not to return for another season with the team. Even though his agent insinuated that he might sign a contract with the San Antonio Spurs, this was not the case. At a press conference in February 2005 at the Utah Jazz’s Delta Center, Malone officially announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons, and nearly 1900 games.</p><p>However, in the international arena, Karl Malone had much better luck, being a member of the US team at the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympic Games, which won gold medals.</p><p>In addition to his game-playing records and achievements, Karl Malone was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.</p><p>In 2007, Malone became director of basketball promotion and assistant strength and conditioning coach at his alma mater, Louisiana Tech University and donated $350,000 to the university athletic department. Currently the legendary basketball player is a big man coach at the Utah Jazz.</p><p>In his personal life, Malone married Kay Kinsey, a former beauty queen, in 1990, and they have four children. Karl also fathered three children prior to his marriage.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.03125><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Karl Malone</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$75 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>24 July 1963</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Summerfield, Louisiana, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>265 lbs (120 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Wrestler, Basketball player, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Louisiana Tech University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Kay Kinsey (m. 1990)</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Children</td><td>Demetress Bell, Cheryl Ford, K.J.
